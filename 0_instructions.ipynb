    "\n",
    "Google Colab (short for Google Collaboratory) is a cloud-based platform for writing and running Python code in a notebook format. It is built on Jupyter Notebook, and accessible directly through a web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "it is accessible from this link: https://colab.research.google.com/ and integrates with you existing Google account, so you can access data from eg. your Google Drive. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does Google Colab Compare to Local Python Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may remember from Urban Economics, managing Python environments can be quite complicated. Colab uses a Python environment prepared for machine learning workflows, with many packages pre-installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are sharing code with many people, it's an easy way of ensuring everyone meets the requirements to run your code and access the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you can make the virtual machine have access to quite powerful hardware, for a relatively low price. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are many limitations and restrictions relative to running code on a local machine. "

I recommend the account where you have your Google Drive, presumably your CEMFI account, since part of the content of the course will be about loading and saving data from your Google Drive, as well as loading and saving Colab notebooks to your Google Drive."

    "You can access anything from Meta's Llama model: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct to a web-scraped dataset of videogame sales numbers since the 1980s: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings\n",
